# Menu Explorer
A full stack Menu Explorer application with authentication, CRUD functionality, and MVC structure. Logged in users can use to view menus from their favorite restaurants all in one place so they don't have to go searching through the web. 

**Video DEMO:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HA_pkBhOta8

## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** EJS, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB

Following MVC structure to create this app, the views are displayed using EJS and CSS. CRUD functionality is utilized for users so that once users log in, they can get menu information, post new menu information, and delete what they no longer need. 

## Lessons Learned:

Challenged myself to connect multiple ejs pages for different interfaces depending on wether or not user was logged in. Learned new ways to implement user authentication. 

## Next Steps for this Project
Make it so that displayed data is specific to logged in user and only visible by them.

## How to use
Clone or download the code
npm install
set up your own .env with DB_CONNECTION = "your mongoDB connection string" and PORT
npm start
